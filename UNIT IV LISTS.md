**KEY TERMINOLOGIES**

- Mutable – the value of the variable can be changed 
- Immutable – the value of the variable cannot be changed
- Slice – to print a part of a variable it is especially used in the list. It uses slice operator [:]
- Aliasing – duplicating a list which points to a same memory. If any changes made in original list it will be reflected in the duplicated list. It is different from copying a list.
- Cloning – creating a copy of a list with different memory location. It is also called as copying a list.
- Indexing – accessing the items of a list or tuple through its position.
- Key-Value pair – In dictionary, the data is held key:value manner in which, Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable. Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable. Dictionary keys are case sensitive, the same name but different cases of Key will be treated distinctly.
