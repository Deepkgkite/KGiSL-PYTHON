Learn how to program in Python and get ready for a career in data science, machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence.
<ul>
<li>
<p>Python foundation Nanodegree - <a href="https://in.udacity.com/course/python-foundation-nanodegree--nd002-inpy">https://in.udacity.com/course/python-foundation-nanodegree–nd002-inpy</a>   - Mentored learning, all online ( paid, but can win a 100% cash back from KGISL if you complete it successfully)</p>

<p>Ideally for 2nd year or 3rd year engineering students <a href="https://in.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025">https://in.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree–nd025</a>  - It will take 7 months to complete and a lot of work. Time management is essential.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-recommendation">My recommendation</h2>
<p>My preference (if I were a motivated and career oriented student) would be Udacity as it also enhances my personal brand with a Udacity <strong>Nano-degree.</strong> Students who make this chioce need to very disciplined about time management and energy management, to ensure that they balance their academic work load as well.</p>
<h2 id="recommended-action-items">Recommended Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>get students to choose</li>
<li>organize them into “clubs” depending upon which pathway they choose</li>
<li>Assign faculty / student / professional mentors to help facilitate infrastructure and guidance each of the “clubs”</li>
</ul>
