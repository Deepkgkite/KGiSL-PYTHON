<p>My preference (if I were a motivated and career oriented student) would be Udacity as it also enhances my personal brand with a Udacity <strong>Nano-degree.</strong>. Students must be made aware that they will need to very disciplined about time management and energy management, to ensure that they will not have any arrears in their academic subjects.</p>
