# Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries 

- Lists: list operations, list slices, list methods, list loop, mutability, aliasing, cloning lists, list parameters; 
- Tuples: tuple assignment, tuple as return value; 
- Dictionaries: operations and methods; 
- Advanced list processing - list comprehension;

## Simplifying terms

- mutability - > ability to mutated, to be changed, to be modified 
    - immutability -> cannot be changed 
- aliasing - nicknames - multiple names for the same object 
	- Rajesh is the name of a boy; 'Ramki' might be the name used by his close relatives; "Bondaaaa" might be the name used by his close friends; 'Ramki' and "Bondaaa" are aliases (nicknames) for Rajesh
- Cloning -> making *identical* copies of each other. Cloning a goat using stem cells is about duplicating what is already available

## List Mutability 

Pre-requisite: http://j.mp/immutablePython

From [https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/11/13/is-python-callbyvalue-or-callbyreference-neither/](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/11/13/is-python-callbyvalue-or-callbyreference-neither/)

This brings us to an important point: there are actually two kinds of objects in Python. A  _mutable_  object exhibits time-varying behavior. Changes to a mutable object are visible through all names bound to it. Python's lists are an example of mutable objects. An  _immutable_  object does not exhibit time-varying behavior. The value of immutable objects can not be modified after they are created. They  _can_  be used to compute the values of  **new**  objects, which is how a function like string.join works. When you think about it, this dichotomy is necessary because, again, everything is an object in Python. If integers were not immutable I could change the meaning of the number '2' throughout my program.

It would be incorrect to say that "mutable objects can change and immutable ones can't", however. Consider the following:


## List Comprehension 
Pre-requisite; http://j.mp/listBenefit 

List comprehensions are concise ways to create lists. The general syntax is:

	[<expression> for <item> in <sequence> if  <condition>]

where the `if` clause is optional. For example,

```python
mylist = [1,2,3,4,5]
yourlist = [item ** 2 for item in mylist]
print(yourlist)
# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

### Quiz
What is printed by the following statements? Or, what is the output of the following statements? 

```python
alist = [4,2,8,6,5]
blist = [num*2 for num in alist if num%2==1]
print(blist)
```


## List Parameters 

[Python has no pass by value](https://medium.com/@george.smith2024/there-is-no-pass-by-value-in-python-5a0efa544736?source=responses---------13-----------------------)

There is no pass by value in Python. Functions arguments are always passed by reference (or object reference, to be exact). The reason that numbers donâ€™t change even if they are passed by reference is because of their immutability.
