# Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries 

- Lists: list operations, list slices, list methods, list loop, mutability, aliasing, cloning lists, list parameters; 
- Tuples: tuple assignment, tuple as return value; 
- Dictionaries: operations and methods; 
- Advanced list processing - list comprehension;

## Simplifying terms

- mutability - > ability to mutated, to be changed, to be modified 
    - immutability -> cannot be changed 
- aliasing - nicknames - multiple names for the same object 
	- Rajesh is the name of a boy; 'Ramki' might be the name used by his close relatives; "Bondaaaa" might be the name used by his close friends; 'Ramki' and "Bondaaa" are aliases (nicknames) for Rajesh
- Cloning -> making *identical* copies of each other. Cloning a goat using stem cells is about duplicating what is already available
